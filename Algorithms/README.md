## Setup
Refer to the main 'readme.md' in the directory above.  This 'readme.md' contains additional
information in setting up the 'virtual environment' and running the scripts in this
subdirectory. 

## Environment
To utilize these scripts, a virtual environment is created so that the installation of (various libraries) remains
local to this subdirectory, and does not affect the rest of the machine.

The virtual environment can be setup using the command: 
**'python -m venv "ALGenv" --upgrade-deps --prompt="ALGenv"'**

To start/stop the virtual environment, use the commands: **'ALGenv\scripts\activate'** or **'deactivate'**. Once
activated, the virtual environment will change the (terminal) prompt from (PS) to (ALGenv).

After starting the virtual environment, (various libraries) can be installed with the command:  
**'python -m pip install library'**.  Subsequently the installation can be verified with the command: 
**'python -m pip show library'**.
