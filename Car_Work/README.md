## File List
**my_cars.py** - a script to monitor and report on "car" statistics.  Known data is hardwired into
                 the top of this file.  Update routines are available, but the data should be 
                 manually adjusted (in the script) since updated data is not currently permanent.

**car_package** - a package of .py files/classes to facilitate the scripts in this subdirectory. There
                  is a parent class and two sub-classes in this package.
