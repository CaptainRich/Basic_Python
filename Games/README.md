## Setup
Refer to the main 'readme.md' in the directory above.  There is no special setup required for
the scripts in this subdirectory.  

This script can be run from the terminal in VS-Code or from a command prompt by issuing 
the command:  'python conway.py' .  


## Technolgies_Used
Just standard libraries: random, time, copy, sys


## File List
**conway.py**  - a script illustrating Conway's Game of Life, an example of cellular automata.  For 
                 additional details on this script (game), see page 102 of 'Automate the Boring Stuff
                 with Python'.  Note that the code in the text doesn't work because it attempts to
                 update 'str' values.  Instead of a 'list of lists', a dictionary is used so that
                 the character content of the grid cells can be changed.
