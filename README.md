## Setup
There are two ways to use these small programs: (1) the Python IDLE or (2) VS Code.

For the Python IDLE, just start the IDLE (which opens a Python Shell), then select File/New
(which opens an Editor).  From the Editor, F5 will run the file with the output or 
diagnostics (tracebacks) appearing in the Shell.

For VS Code it is important to change the Terminal from "Git Bash" to "Power Shell".
Once in Power Shell, the command "python <filename>.py will run the file with the 
output going to the terminal.  Note the suffix ".py" is required.
